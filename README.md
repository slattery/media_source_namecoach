# Media Source Namecoach

This module takes an email key and searches using the Name Coach API to find records. 
 If a record is found, the data is stored in a NameCoach media entity.   

Currently we don't pull in the audio file, we use the components given to us for playback,
which can be set using the field formatter.

This comes with a media type in addition to the media source.   


## TODO

- Tests to make sure configs load and work
- More templates and display modes to allow for prounouns and phonetics
- Explain better how to use auto labelling.
